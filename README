This script has has been tested on MacOS 10.12, using the homebrew version of MySQL 5.7.  It might work on other versions, but likely will need the MySQL paths updated at a minimum

Usefull for people not wanting to create excessive wear on, for instance, their SSD drives when
running full-DB integration tests.

By default, a 1024M RAM-disk is created. The MySQL installation is accessible through a UNIX socket with the user root and the password 'secret'.
Connect to your ramdisk-mysql install like this:

$ mysql -u root -p --socket=/tmp/myramdisk.sock
